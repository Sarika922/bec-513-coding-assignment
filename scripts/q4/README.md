sys and pandas libraries were imported for argument handling and data manipulation.
Argument count was validated using len(sys.argv) to ensure correct usage of the script.
Input data was read from sys.stdin, and integers were extracted using list comprehension.
Quantiles were calculated using pandas.qcut() to split data into equal groups.
Quantile bin edges were extracted using retbins=True from pandas.qcut().
Quantile labels were generated for each quantile using list comprehension.
Data points were assigned to quantiles using pandas.qcut() with labels.
Results were printed with values, quantiles, and intervals in a tab-separated format.
